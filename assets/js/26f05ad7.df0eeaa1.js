The chosen model, TTMs, is extremely efficient and its inference can be executed hundreds of times per second on a single GPU. The forecasted data is then stored in the database (i.e., CrateDB in Krateo). The scheduler reads the data and, based on the forecasting, decides when and where to deploy the VM to minimize carbon intensity. Once decided, the mutating webhook finishes and the resource is mutated with the time and region.
