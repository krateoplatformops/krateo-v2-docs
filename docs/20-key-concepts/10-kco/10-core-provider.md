## Glossary

- **CRD (Custom Resource Definition):** A Kubernetes resource that defines custom objects and their schemas, enabling users to extend Kubernetes functionality.
- **CompositionDefinition:** A CompositionDefinition is a declarative Krateo resource that serves as a master blueprint for a deployable service. It consumes a standard Helm chart as input and uses it to dynamically generate a new, high-level Custom Resource Definition (CRD) in Kubernetes. This process effectively registers the application as a new API within the cluster. It abstracts underlying Helm complexity, establishing a standardized and reusable template for creating application instances.
- **Composition:** A Composition is a Custom Resource representing a single, live instance of a service defined by a CompositionDefinition. Its CRD is generated from the `values.schema.json` file of the Helm chart associated with the CompositionDefinition. The creation of a Composition resource triggers the installation of the associated Helm chart. Its spec field allows for per-instance configuration overrides, enabling customized deployments from a single, authoritative blueprint.
- **CDC (Composition Dynamic Controller):** A dedicated controller deployed by the Core Provider for each CompositionDefinition. The CDC is responsible for managing the lifecycle (create, update, delete) of Helm releases based on Composition resources.
- **Helm Chart:** A package of pre-configured Kubernetes resources used to deploy applications.
- **OCI Registry:** A container registry that supports the Open Container Initiative (OCI) image format, used for storing and distributing Helm charts.
- **RBAC Policy:** A set of rules that define permissions for accessing Kubernetes resources. Typically composed of roles, role bindings, cluster roles, and cluster role bindings assigned to service accounts.
- **values.schema.json:** A JSON Schema file included in Helm charts to define and validate the structure of `values.yaml`.

## Architecture

![core-provider Architecture Image](/img/kco/core-provider-architecture.png "core-provider Architecture")

This diagram outlines the high-level architecture and interactions within the Core Provider, responsible for managing CompositionDefinitions and related resources. It illustrates the relationships between key components such as the Core Provider itself, the Composition Dynamic Controller (CDC), the Chart Inspector, and various Kubernetes resources.

The Core Provider generates CRDs, creates RBAC policies, and deploys the CDC. The CDC manages Helm chart releases, requests resource information from the Chart Inspector, and generates RBAC policies based on those resources. The diagram highlights the flow of definitions and resources between these components, showcasing how the Core Provider orchestrates the deployment and management of composed applications within a Kubernetes cluster.

## Workflow

![core-provider State Diagram](/img/kco/core-provider-flow.png "core-provider State Diagram")

This diagram illustrates the Core Provider's workflow for managing CompositionDefinitions, which define how resources are composed and managed in a Kubernetes environment. It encompasses the lifecycle of Helm releases and associated resources, involving the creation and updating of CRDs (Custom Resource Definitions), RBAC (Role-Based Access Control), and CDC (Composition Dynamic Controller) deployments. These actions are conditional, based on chart versions and the current state of the cluster.

**Note:** The `kubectl` commands within the notes serve as illustrative examples of the operations performed by the Core Provider and are not intended for direct user execution. They provide insights into the resource management processes undertaken by the system.

## CompositionDefinition specifications and examples

The `core-provider` is a Kubernetes operator that downloads and manages Helm charts. It checks for the existence of `values.schema.json` and uses it to generate a Custom Resource Definition (CRD) in Kubernetes, accurately representing the possible values that can be expressed for the installation of the chart.

Kubernetes is designed to validate resource inputs before applying them to the cluster, and the `core-provider` provides input validation to ensure that incorrect inputs are not accepted.

### Defining an Helm Chart compliant with core-provider

A Composition in Krateo is fundamentally a Helm Chart archive (.tgz) that must include a JSON Schema for its values.yaml file. This schema file must be named values.schema.json and is crucial for enabling Krateo's powerful declarative management capabilities.

The values.schema.json file acts as a contract, defining the structure, data types, and validation rules for the configuration values your Helm chart accepts. Krateo's core-provider leverages this schema to:

- Generate Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs): A precise CRD is automatically created in Kubernetes, reflecting the configurable parameters of your Helm chart.
- Enforce Input Validation: Kubernetes can then validate any Custom Resource (CR) instance created from this CRD against the schema, preventing incorrect or malformed configurations from being applied.
- Enable a Robust User Experience: By ensuring only valid configurations are submitted, Krateo provides a more stable and predictable deployment environment.
While generic online tools exist for JSON Schema generation, Krateo PlatformOps provides its own official and highly recommended command-line tool: krateoctl. This tool is specifically designed to generate valid and compliant values.schema.json files that are perfectly aligned with Krateo's internal validation mechanisms.

#### How to use `krateoctl` to generate values.schema.json

1. Install `krateoctl` by following the instructions at [Krateoctl Installation Guide](https://github.com/krateoplatformops/krateoctl/blob/main/README.md).
2. Run the following command to get the documentation for the use of the `gen-schema` command:

   ```bash
   krateoctl gen-schema --help
   ```

   Be sure to read the documentation carefully to understand how to use the command effectively and the requirements of the `values.yaml` file. You could also refers to the examples [provided in the documentation](https://github.com/krateoplatformops/krateoctl/tree/main/testdata).

3. Generate the `values.schema.json` file by executing:

   ```bash
   krateoctl gen-schema path/to/your/values.yaml -output path/to/output/values.schema.json
   ```
### Authentication

The `core-provider` also handles authentication to private OCI registries and Helm repositories. Users can provide their credentials through Kubernetes secrets, and the `core-provider` will use them to download the necessary chart resources.

#### OCI Registry

Create the Kubernetes secret:

```bash
kubectl create secret generic docker-hub --from-literal=token=your_token -n krateo-system
```

```yaml
apiVersion: core.krateo.io/v1alpha1
kind: CompositionDefinition
metadata:
  annotations:
     "krateo.io/connector-verbose": "true"
  name: fireworks-private
  namespace: krateo-system
spec:
  chart:
    url: oci://registry-1.docker.io/yourusername/fireworks-app
    version: "0.1.0"
    credentials:
      username: yourusername
      passwordRef:
        key: token
        name: docker-hub
        namespace: krateo-system
```

##### GCP Artifact Registry

Follow [this guide](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/keys-create-delete) to create a service account key. You will need to download the .json file containing the key and create the Kubernetes secret from it. Note that the service account should have permissions to download from the Google Artifact Registry.

Now, create a secret from the JSON file containing your service account key:

```bash
kubectl create secret generic gcp-sa-secret -n demo \
 --from-file=secret-access-credentials=/path/to/file/krateoregistry-3d546566ae4a.json
```

```yaml
apiVersion: core.krateo.io/v1alpha1
kind: CompositionDefinition
metadata:
  name: fireworks-private
  namespace: krateo-system
spec:
  chart:
    url: oci://europe-west12-docker.pkg.dev/krateoregistry/krateotest/fireworks-app
    version: "0.0.1"
    credentials:
      username: json_key
      passwordRef: # reference to a secret
        key: secret-access-credentials
        name: gcp-sa-secret
        namespace: demo
```

**Note:** The `spec.chart.credentials.username` should be set to `json_key` as explained in [this documentation](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/helm/authentication#linux-macos_1).

#### Helm Repository

```bash
kubectl create secret generic helm-repo --from-literal=token=your_token -n krateo-system
```

```yaml
apiVersion: core.krateo.io/v1alpha1
kind: CompositionDefinition
metadata:
  annotations:
     "krateo.io/connector-verbose": "true"
  name: fireworks-private
  namespace: krateo-system
spec:
  chart:
    repo: fireworks-app
    url: https://theurltoyourhelmrepo
    version: 0.3.0
    credentials:
      username: yourusername
      passwordRef:
        key: token
        name: helm-repo
        namespace: krateo-system
```

## Security by Design

The Core Provider is built with security as a primary focus:

- **Schema-Driven Security**: By generating CRDs from values.schema.json, the provider ensures all inputs are validated by the Kubernetes API server, rejecting invalid configurations.
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Each deployed composition-dynamic-controller (CDC) is granted only the minimal RBAC permissions required to manage the resources defined within its specific Helm chart.
- **Automatic Cleanup**: When a CompositionDefinition is deleted, the Core Provider automatically removes the associated CRD, CDC deployment, and all RBAC policies, leaving no orphaned resources.
- **Secure Webhooks**: Implements mutating and conversion webhooks for advanced schema validation and safe, multi-version API management.

## Best Practices

- **Always Define a Schema**: Every Helm chart intended for Krateo should include a comprehensive values.schema.json file. This is the cornerstone of creating robust and predictable compositions.
- **Use the paused Annotation**: To temporarily halt reconciliation for a composition (e.g., for debugging or manual intervention), apply the `krateo.io/paused: "true"` annotation to the CompositionDefinition.
- **Leverage Multi-Version Support**: Manage upgrades and rollbacks smoothly by publishing new chart versions and updating your CompositionDefinition. The Core Provider will handle the deployment of a new controller, allowing old and new instances to coexist until migrated.
