### **Composition Dynamic Controller (CDC) & Chart Inspector: Secure Helm Lifecycle Management**

The **Composition Dynamic Controller (CDC)** is a specialized Kubernetes operator that orchestrates the end-to-end lifecycle of Krateo compositions. Acting as the reconciliation engine for Composition custom resources, it bridges declarative application definitions with Helm’s packaging system through intelligent automation. The **Chart Inspector** serves as its "safety advisor," enabling proactive decision-making via dry-run analysis.

#### **Core CDC Workflow (with Chart Inspector Integration)**
1. **Reconciliation Trigger**  
   - Watches for changes to `Composition` CRs or Helm chart versions.  
   - Invokes the **Chart Inspector** to simulate installations/upgrades *before* execution.

2. **Dry-Run Analysis Phase** (*Chart Inspector*)  
   ```bash
   helm install --dry-run=server <chart> --version <ver>  # Returns:
   ```
   - **Resource Manifest List**: All Kubernetes objects (Deployments, CRDs, etc.) the chart would create along with filename to .  
   - **Dependency Graph**: Order of operations (e.g., CRDs before custom resources).

3. **RBAC Auto-Provisioning** (*CDC*)  
   - Dynamically generates **least-privilege** Roles/ClusterRoles based on the Inspector’s output.  
   - Ensures the CDC’s service account has *exactly* the permissions needed—no more, no less.

4. **Atomic Execution** (*CDC*)  
   - Proceeds with `helm install/upgrade` *only* after successful dry-run and RBAC setup.

### **Key Capabilities Enabled by This Collaboration**

| **Feature**                | **CDC’s Role**                          | **Chart Inspector’s Contribution**                  |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Version-Sensitive Reconciliation** | Detects chart version drift; rolls forward/back. | Identifies version-specific resource changes during dry-run. |
| **Atomic Upgrades**         | Ensures all-or-nothing upgrades.        | Pre-flights resource compatibility (e.g., CRD schema changes). |
| **Self-Healing**            | Corrects configuration drift.           | Provides baseline "desired state" for comparison.   |
| **Declarative Enforcement** | Continuously reconciles actual vs. desired state. | Supplies the desired state *before* cluster changes. |
| **Secure RBAC**             | Generates minimal required permissions. | Audits chart manifests for required API operations. |

---

### **Why This Architecture Matters**
1. **Safety Net**  
   - The Chart Inspector’s dry-run prevents "helm surprises" (e.g., undeclared CRD creations or namespace pollution).  
   - Example: Blocks a chart upgrade if the new version requires a `ClusterRole` the CDC isn’t authorized to manage.

2. **GitOps Compliance**  
   - The CDC enforces *declarative intent* by reconciling against the dry-run’s output, not just Helm’s last-applied state.  
   - Self-healing kicks in if manual changes violate the composition’s definition.

3. **Multi-Tenancy Ready**  
   - RBAC is scoped per-composition, isolating teams/projects.  
   - The Inspector’s resource listing ensures no cross-tenant leakage (e.g., a composition can’t create resources in forbidden namespaces).

---

### **Real-World Example: Handling a Breaking Chart Change**
1. **Scenario**: A Helm chart v1.2.0 introduces a new `CustomResourceDefinition` (CRD).  
2. **CDC+Inspector Flow**:  
   - **Dry-run** detects the new CRD and its required API group permissions.  
   - **CDC** creates a `ClusterRole` granting `create/get/list` for the CRD.  
   - **Upgrade** proceeds *only after* the CRD and RBAC are confirmed active.  
3. **Result**: Zero downtime; no "helm upgrade failed: CRD missing" errors.


## Composition Dynamic Controller Values Injection

The composition-dynamic-controller inject labels and values into the installed resources and in the helm chart release values. This values contains informations about the composition resource associated with the helm release.
The values are injected in the following way:

| Helm Chart Release Values | Installed Resources Labels | Description |
|:--------------------------|:---------------------------|:------------|
| `global.compositionId`    | `krateo.io/composition-id` | The composition resource uid |
| `global.compositionName`  | `krateo.io/composition-name` | The composition resource name |
| `global.compositionNamespace` | `krateo.io/composition-namespace` | The composition resource namespace |
| `global.compositionInstalledVersion` | `krateo.io/composition-installed-version` | The version of the composition resource installed. This value changes if the chart version is upgraded |
| `global.compositionApiVersion` | not injected | The api version of the composition resource. This values is deprecated but is mainteined for backward compatibility. |
| `global.compositionGroup` | `krateo.io/composition-group` | The group of the composition resource. |
| `global.compositionResource` | `krateo.io/composition-resource` | The plural name of the composition resource. |
| `global.compositionKind` | `krateo.io/composition-kind` | The kind of the composition resource. |
| `global.krateoNamespace` | `krateo.io/krateo-namespace` | The namespace where Krateo is installed. This value is used to identify the Krateo resources in the cluster. |
| `global.gracefullyPaused`| not injected | This value is set to `true` if the annotation `krateo.io/gracefully-paused` is set on the composition resource. This value is used to pause the reconciliation of the composition resource only after the value is injected in the helm release values with a successful helm upgrade. Read the [paragraph below](#about-the-gracefullypaused-value) for more details. |

### About the `gracefullyPaused` value

The `global.gracefullyPaused` value provides a way to gracefully pause both the composition resource and all Krateo resources within its Helm chart.

#### How it works:
1. **Trigger**: Set the annotation `krateo.io/gracefully-paused` on the composition resource
2. **Activation**: The pause takes effect only after the next successful Helm upgrade injects this value into the chart
3. **Scope**: Pauses both the composition reconciliation AND any Krateo resources in the chart that respect the `krateo.io/paused` annotation

#### Use cases:
- **Graceful pause**: Temporarily halt all composition-related activity without resource deletion
- **Coordinated pause**: Ensure both the composition and its managed resources pause simultaneously
- **Safe maintenance**: Pause operations during maintenance windows

#### Comparison with `krateo.io/paused`:

| Annotation | Scope | When it takes effect |
|------------|-------|---------------------|
| `krateo.io/gracefully-paused` | Composition + chart resources | After next Helm upgrade |
| `krateo.io/paused` | Composition only | Immediately |

**Example**: Use `krateo.io/gracefully-paused` when you need to pause an entire application stack, or `krateo.io/paused` for immediate composition-only pausing.

#### How to include the pause in a resource included in the chart

To include the pause in a resource included in the chart, you can use the `krateo.io/paused` annotation on the resource. This will ensure that the resource is paused when the composition is paused.

```yaml
apiVersion: git.krateo.io/v1alpha1
kind: Repo
metadata:
  name: {{ include "fireworks-app.fullname" . }}-repo
  labels:
    {{- include "fireworks-app.labels" . | nindent 4 }}
  annotations:
    krateo.io/paused: "{{ default false (and .Values.global .Values.global.gracefullyPaused) }}"
spec:
...
```
