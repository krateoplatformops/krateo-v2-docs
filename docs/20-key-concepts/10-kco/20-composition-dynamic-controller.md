# Composition Dynamic Controller
The composition-dynamic-controller is an operator that is instantiated by the [core-provider](https://github.com/krateoplatformops/core-provider) to manage the Custom Resources whose Custom Resource Definition is generated by the core-provider.

### **Composition Dynamic Controller (CDC) & Chart Inspector: Secure Helm Lifecycle Management**

The **Composition Dynamic Controller (CDC)** is a specialized Kubernetes operator that orchestrates the end-to-end lifecycle of Krateo compositions. Acting as the reconciliation engine for Composition custom resources, it bridges declarative application definitions with Helm’s packaging system through intelligent automation. The **Chart Inspector** serves as its "safety advisor," enabling proactive decision-making via dry-run analysis.

#### **Core CDC Workflow (with Chart Inspector Integration)**
1. **Reconciliation Trigger**  
   - Watches for changes to `Composition` CRs or Helm chart versions.  
   - Invokes the **Chart Inspector** to simulate installations/upgrades *before* execution.

2. **Dry-Run Analysis Phase** (*Chart Inspector*)  
   ```bash
   helm install --dry-run=server <chart> --version <ver>  # Returns:
   ```
   - **Resource Manifest List**: All Kubernetes objects (Deployments, CRDs, etc.) the chart would create along with filename to .  
   - **Dependency Graph**: Order of operations (e.g., CRDs before custom resources).

3. **RBAC Auto-Provisioning** (*CDC*)  
   - Dynamically generates **least-privilege** Roles/ClusterRoles based on the Inspector’s output.  
   - Ensures the CDC’s service account has *exactly* the permissions needed—no more, no less.

4. **Atomic Execution** (*CDC*)  
   - Proceeds with `helm install/upgrade` *only* after successful dry-run and RBAC setup.

### **Key Capabilities Enabled by This Collaboration**

| **Feature**                | **CDC’s Role**                          | **Chart Inspector’s Contribution**                  |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Version-Sensitive Reconciliation** | Detects chart version drift; rolls forward/back. | Identifies version-specific resource changes during dry-run. |
| **Atomic Upgrades**         | Ensures all-or-nothing upgrades.        | Pre-flights resource compatibility (e.g., CRD schema changes). |
| **Self-Healing**            | Corrects configuration drift.           | Provides baseline "desired state" for comparison.   |
| **Declarative Enforcement** | Continuously reconciles actual vs. desired state. | Supplies the desired state *before* cluster changes. |
| **Secure RBAC**             | Generates minimal required permissions. | Audits chart manifests for required API operations. |

### **Why This Architecture Matters**
1. **Safety Net**  
   - The Chart Inspector’s dry-run prevents "helm surprises" (e.g., undeclared CRD creations or namespace pollution).  
   - Example: Blocks a chart upgrade if the new version requires a `ClusterRole` the CDC isn’t authorized to manage.

2. **GitOps Compliance**  
   - The CDC enforces *declarative intent* by reconciling against the dry-run’s output, not just Helm’s last-applied state.  
   - Self-healing kicks in if manual changes violate the composition’s definition.

3. **Multi-Tenancy Ready**  
   - RBAC is scoped per-composition, isolating teams/projects.  
   - The Inspector’s resource listing ensures no cross-tenant leakage (e.g., a composition can’t create resources in forbidden namespaces).

---

### **Real-World Example: Handling a Breaking Chart Change**
1. **Scenario**: A Helm chart v1.2.0 introduces a new `CustomResourceDefinition` (CRD).  
2. **CDC+Inspector Flow**:  
   - **Dry-run** detects the new CRD and its required API group permissions.  
   - **CDC** creates a `ClusterRole` granting `create/get/list` for the CRD.  
   - **Upgrade** proceeds *only after* the CRD and RBAC are confirmed active.  
3. **Result**: Zero downtime; no "helm upgrade failed: CRD missing" errors.
