# What is Krateo Composable Portal (KCP)?

Our concept of a Krateo Composable Portal refers to a portal that is built using a modular architecture. This design allows for the flexible combination of different functionalities or services to create a tailored experience for users. In the context of Krateo - a platform operations solution- the Composable Portal could serve as a central hub for managing, integrating, and deploying various platform services with a focus on customizability and scalability.

Our composable portal includes:

* Modular Design: Enables the addition, removal, or update of features and services without changing a single line of code.
* User-Centric Interface: Offers a user-friendly interface for both administrators and end-users to interact with the platform's capabilities.
* Integration Capabilities: Facilitates the integration with other services, APIs, and tools to extend the portal's functionality.
* Customization and Flexibility: Allows users to customize the portal to meet specific operational needs, reflecting the unique workflows and processes of their organization.
* Scalability: Designed to scale with the organization's needs, supporting an increasing number of services, users, or data volumes efficiently.

It is important to note that Krateo does not have its own separate backend, but rather relies entirely on Kubernetes. To clarify, Krateo is an extension of Kubernetes and is not a standalone software that runs on Kubernetes. Krateo's Composable Portal serves as a graphical interface to interact with Kubernetes.

KCP consists of the following features:
* krateo-frontend
* krateo-bff
* krateo-gateway
* frontend-provider
* authn-service

## krateo-frontend

Our frontend (https://github.com/krateoplatformops/krateo-frontend) can be defined as a data-driven meta-framework, but what does that mean exactly? Essentially, we created an architecture that ensures a consistent user experience by design. This is achieved by pre-packaging graphic elements and layouts that can be used and composed to build the portal pages.

It's important to note that the Krateo portal should not be seen as a black box, but rather as a central point for collecting valuable information for the platform's users, which is distributed across different systems.

Another important requirement is that the portal must be easily extendable without requiring any coding. All efforts should be focused on understanding how to display services in the catalog, rather than on maintaining forms for collecting information.

In summary, the Krateo frontend queries the backend (Kubernetes) via the backend for the frontend to know which layouts and graphic elements it must process with client-side runtime rendering.

## krateo-bff

A critical architectural choice behind Krateo is that there must be no channel-specific logic querying the backend. In other words, what is displayed and implemented via the portal must be exactly reproducible via the Kubernetes CLI (aka kubectl).

This ensures that all business logic is centralized.

The task of krateo-bff (krateo backend for frontend) is to declaratively provide how the graphic elements of krateo-frontend must be enhanced.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
type: Opaque
metadata:
  name: typicode-endpoint
  namespace: demo-system
stringData:
  server-url: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com
---
apiVersion: widgets.ui.krateo.io/v1alpha1
kind: CardTemplate
metadata:
  name: one
  namespace: demo-system
spec:
  app:
    title: ${ .api2.items[0] | (.name  + " -> " + .email) }
    content: ${ .api2.items[0].body }
    actions:
    - name: view
      endpointRef:
        name: typicode-endpoint
        namespace: demo-system
      path: ${ "/todos/1/comments/" + (.api2.items[0].id|tostring) }
  api:
  - name: api1
    path: "/todos/1"
    endpointRef:
      name: typicode-endpoint
      namespace: demo-system
    verb: GET
    headers:
    - 'Accept: application/json'
  - name: api2
    dependOn: api1
    path: ${ "/todos/" + (.api1.id|tostring) +  "/comments" }
    endpointRef:
      name: typicode-endpoint
      namespace: demo-system
    verb: GET
    headers:
    - 'Accept: application/json'
 ```

A _cardTemplate_ is a Krateo graphic component composed of various properties (_spec.app_ section).

The widget includes call2actions such as deleting the cardTemplate itself (via the trash can button). Any action can be declared under the _spec.app.actions_ section.

Properties can be filled in manually or obtained by querying an API.

This API can represent a further call to the Kubernetes server API (and in this case the krateo-bff will make a call using the client certificate) or to an external API (and in this case it will use the explicit credentials).

The krateo-bff can also make a sequence of API calls and can also iterate an array arrived in response to the call.

## krateo-gateway

The introduction of the krateo-gateway (https://github.com/krateoplatformops/krateo-gateway) between the clients (kubectl or krateo-frontend) and the Kubernetes API was born from the need to analyze in detail the resources on which the user has specific permissions.

For example, Kubernetes RBAC allows you to precisely define the fact that a user can only see certain resources with a specific name. In this case, the user cannot see all the resources of a particular type but only those with that name.

Below is an example role that shows this case:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  name: dev-delete-cardtemplate-one-in-demosystem-namespace
  namespace: demo-system
rules:
- apiGroups:
  - widgets.ui.krateo.io
  resources:
  - cardtemplates
  resourceNames:
  - one
  verbs:
  - get
  - delete
 ```

The krateo-gateway acts for two purposes:
* instead of returning a _deny_ to the user because he does not have the LIST verb, it returns those resources for which he has an associated GET
* reports in the response an annotation "krateo.io/allowed-verbs" which lists all the verbs that that user has associated with the queried resource

This second information is essential for the _krateo-frontend_, which therefore knows which of the various actions to enable or not.

In fact, this allows you to precisely define what each user can see on the Krateo frontend because the associated RBAC is exactly that of Kubernetes

## frontend-provider

## authn-service

Krateo does not have its backend or database but uses Kubernetes to meet these two needs.
Kubernetes can provide different authentication modes (https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/#authentication-strategies), but two are always present by default: authentication via token or certificate.

The first is theoretically used for access by 'technical' users, while the second is used by 'physical' users. We decided to use the second because it is conceptually more correct.

However, we wanted to ensure the user could use their identity provider, so we decided to act as a proxy for external authentication systems.

In the case of successful authentication, the authn-service generates a certificate signed with the CA of the Kubernetes cluster. Not only is the entire certificate generated, but the entire kubeconfig, which the user can download to query Krateo directly with the kubectl.

The API _strategies_ lists all the authentication strategie configured in the cluster.

Different authentication strategies are currently available:

### Basic authentication
