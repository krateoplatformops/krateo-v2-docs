# snowplow

Snowplow is a web service that plays a key role within the suite of components that make up Krateo PlatformOps. 

It serves multiple purposes, primarily acting as a bridge between Krateo's custom resources and the UI. By enabling a dynamic and declarative approach to defining UI components and layouts, Snowplow ensures that the interface is interpreted and rendered seamlessly by Krateo Frontend.

Currently, Snowplow handles on-demand resolution of the `RESTAction` custom resource. For all other custom resources within Krateo, it delegates the task to the Kubernetes API server, which, in turn, leverages Krateoâ€™s custom aggregation API layer to process them. 

Looking ahead, Snowplow will take full responsibility for managing all custom resources beyond RESTAction, eventually eliminating the need for delegation altogether.

As of today, the overall architecture is structured as follows:

## RESTAction 

> This document provides an overview of the `RESTAction` CRD and its properties to facilitate its usage within Kubernetes environments.

## Overview
The `RESTAction` Custom Resource Definition (CRD) allows users to declaratively define calls to APIs that may depend on other API calls.

## Schema `spec` Details

| Property  | Type  | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| `api` | array | Defines API requests to an HTTP service. |
| `filter` | string | A JQ filter that can be applied to the global response. |

#### `api` Array Item Properties

> A single `api` item defines an HTTP REST call. 
> The invoked API **must produce a `JSON` content type**

| Property  | Type  | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| `dependsOn` | object | Defines dependencies on other APIs. |
| `endpointRef` | object | References an Endpoint object. |
| `filter` | string | A JQ expression for response processing. |
| `headers` | array of strings | Custom request headers (each header can be a JQ expression). |
| `name` | string | Unique identifier for the API request. |
| `path` | string | Request URI path (can be a JQ expression). |
| `payload` | string | Request body payload (can be a JQ expression). |
| `verb` | string | HTTP method (defaults to GET if omitted). |

#### `dependsOn` Object Properties

| Property  | Type  | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| `iterator` | string | A JQ expression that returns a JSON array on which to iterate. |
| `name` | string | Name of another API on which this depends. |

#### `endpointRef` Object Properties

> Reference to a Kubernetes secret that describes the HTTP REST API endpoint.

| Property  | Type  | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| `name` | string | Name of the referenced object. |
| `namespace` | string | Namespace of the referenced object. |

### `status` Properties
The `status` field is an open-ended object that preserves unknown fields for storing results of all the `api` calls.


## Examples

Some `RESTAction` examples can be found [here](https://github.com/krateoplatformops/snowplow/tree/main/testdata/restactions). Lets check the one that query [jsonplaceholder.typicode.com](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com) API:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
type: Opaque
metadata:
  name: typicode-endpoint
  namespace: demo-system
stringData:
  server-url: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com
---
apiVersion: templates.krateo.io/v1
kind: RESTAction
metadata:
  name: typicode
  namespace: demo-system
spec:
  filter: "[.todos[] as $todo | .users[] | select(.id == $todo.userId) | { name: .name, id: $todo.id, title: $todo.title, completed: $todo.completed }]"
  api:
  - name: users
    path: "/users"
    endpointRef:
      name: typicode-endpoint
      namespace: demo-system
    filter: map(select(.email | endswith(".biz")))
  - name: todos
    dependsOn: 
      name: users
      iterator: .users
    path: ${ "/todos?userId=" + (.id|tostring) }
    headers:
      - ${ "X-UserID:" + (.id|tostring) }
    endpointRef:
      name: typicode-endpoint
      namespace: demo-system
```
