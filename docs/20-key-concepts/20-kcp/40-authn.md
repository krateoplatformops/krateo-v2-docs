## List available strategies

The `GET /strategies` endpoint shows all available authentication strategies.

> When a particular authentication strategy requires additional configuration parameters, these will be exposed under the _"extensions"_ key. Otherwise this attribute will not be present.

Example:

```sh
$ curl https://api.krateoplatformops.io/authn/strategies
```

## Authentication

Regardless of the strategy used, the response will always be a json with the following structure:

```json
{
   "code":200,
   "user":{
      "displayName":"John Doe",
      "username":"johndoe",
      "avatarURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/585381?v=4"
   },

         {
            "cluster":{

               "server":"https://127.0.0.1:51461"
            },

         }
      ]
   }
}
```

### Login with Basic Authentication

The Authorization header field is constructed as follows:

- username and password are combined with a single colon
  - this means that the username itself cannot contain a colon

- the resulting string is encoded using a variant of Base64 (+/ and with padding)

- the authorization method and a space character (e.g. "Basic ") is then prepended to the encoded string.

For example, if the username is Aladdin and the password is open sesame, then the field's value is the Base64 encoding of Aladdin:open sesame, or QWxhZGRpbjpvcGVuIHNlc2FtZQ==

Then the Authorization header field will appear as: _Authorization: Basic QWxhZGRpbjpvcGVuIHNlc2FtZQ==_

Example:

```sh
curl https://reqbin.com/echo
   -H "Authorization: Basic QWxhZGRpbjpvcGVuIHNlc2FtZQ=="
```

### Login with OAuth Authorization Code Flow

> Let's take _Github_ as example, the same concept applies to all authentication systems of this type (authorization code flow).

With a valid [authorization code grant](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/access-tokens/authorization-code-request/) invoke the related endpoint `path`, passing the `name` as query string parameter.

Example:

```sh
$ curl -H "X-Auth-Code: $(AUTH_CODE)" \
    https://api.krateoplatformops.io/authn/oauth/login?name=github-example
```

The `RestActionRef` is mandatory because, unlike OIDC, OAuth2 returns only the bearer token and no information regarding the user, therefore, the RESTAction is required to compile all fields. See the [RESTAction Configuration](#restaction-configuration) section for more information.

### Login with LDAP

To login using LDAP credentials must be sent as JSON using POST:

```sh
$ curl -X POST "https://api.krateoplatformops.io/authn/ldap/login?name=openldap" \
   -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
   -d '{"username":"XXXXXX","password":"YYYYYY"}'
```

### Login with OIDC

To login using OIDC credentials, the authorization code must be sent throught the `X-Auth-Code` header field:

```sh
$ curl -H "X-Auth-Code: $(AUTH_CODE)" \
    https://api.krateoplatformops.io/authn/oidc/login?name=oidc-example
```

The authn application supports the Discovery endpoint. If you provide a Discovery endpoint the values for `authorizationURL`, `tokenURL` and `userInfoURL` are ignored and overwritten. If you do not provide a Discovery endpoint, the values for `authorizationURL`, `tokenURL` and `userInfoURL` are used.

To obtain proper groups mappings you need to configure the ID Token response on the application side. Likewise for the profile picture. Examples are listed below for Azure and KeyCloak. Alternatively, you can use the RESTAction. See the [RESTAction Configuration](#restaction-configuration) section for more information.

#### Azure
Azure can be configured to authenticate users through OIDC ([Official Azure Documentation for OIDC](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/v2-protocols-oidc)). To achieve this, you need to create a new app registration as follows:

On Azure:
 - Go to "App registrations" and then hit "New registration";
 - Configure the display name, account types and Redirect URI. The redirect URI must point to Krateo's frontend with an HTTPS endpoint and the path `/auth/oidc`;
 - Create a client secret in "Certificates & secrets", save the value of the secret now as it cannot be visualized afterwards;
 - In the "Authentication" menu, find and activate `Access tokens` and `ID tokens`;
 - In the "API permissions" menu, add the following: `openid`, `email`, `profile`, `User.Read` and `User.ReadBasic.All`;

To obtain groups you can do one of the following:
- Include them in the OIDC ID Token response: in the "Manifest" menu in the Azure portal, modify the value `groupMembershipClaims` to `All` ([Official Azure documentation for the groupMembershipClaims](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/reference-app-manifest#groupmembershipclaims-attribute));
- Use the following RESTAction and place it in the `RestActionRef` of the OIDC custom resource:
```yaml
apiVersion: templates.krateo.io/v1
kind: RESTAction
metadata:
  name: test-rest-action
  namespace: krateo-system
spec:
  api:
  - name: groups
    verb: GET
    headers:
    - 'Accept: application/json'
    path: "v1.0/me/memberOf?$select=displayName"
    endpointRef:
      name: azure-entra
      namespace: krateo-system
    filter: .value | map(.displayName)
```
To obtain groups through the rest action, add `Directory.Read.All` in the `additionalScopes`.

On AuthN:
 - To obtain the user avatar/profile image include `User.Read` in the `additionalScopes` field of the OIDCConfiguration custom resource;
 - You can now configure the Authn's CR by using Azure discovery URL, which will be in the following format:
 ```
https://login.microsoftonline.com/<your-tenant-id>/v2.0/.well-known/openid-configuration
 ```

Scopes in the `additionalScopes` field can be simply separated with a space. Example for Azure groups with the RESTAction:
```yaml
  additionalScopes: User.Read Directory.Read.All
```

##### Troubleshooting
If you do not get the correct groups in the AuthN response, please verify your Azure OIDC configuration: the manifest value "groupMembershipClaims:All" adds in the JWT ID Token the value "groups", which contains an array of UIDs of the groups the user belongs. You can check the JWT ID Token returned by Azure by simulating the calls to the Authorization and Token endpoints through Postman or curl. The exact endpoints are contained in the "well-known" endpoint (Authorization and Token).

On Azure, set the redirect URI to, for example, "http://localhost:8080" for testing without HTTPS, then open the following page in a web browser:
```
https://login.microsoftonline.com/<tenant-id>/oauth2/v2.0/authorize?client_id=<client-id>&response_type=code&redirect_uri=http://localhost:8080&response_mode=query&scope=openid email profile User.Read
```
Login, then Azure will redirect you to the redirect URI, which will error out, however, there will be a "code" query parameter in the URL. Copy this code parameter being careful not to copy other query parameters. Through cURL or Postman perform a POST to:
```
https://login.microsoftonline.com/<tentant-id>/oauth2/v2.0/token
```
with the following body values:
```
client_id=<client-id>
client_secret=<client-secret>
code=<the code from the redirect url>
redirect_uri=http://localhost:8080
grant_type=authorization_code
```
You can then decode the JWT and verify that "groups" is present with the [Microsoft offline decoder](https://jwt.ms/).

#### KeyCloak
To obtain groups, add a custom mapper of type "Group Membership" and give it the Token Claim Name "groups", uncheck `Full group path`. Add `groups` into the `additionalScopes` field of the OIDCConfiguration custom resource.
To obtain the user avatar/profile image, go to the realm settings, then "User profiles" tab, "Create Attribute", and add one with the name `picture`. Set the profile picture for the user to a URL pointing to a picture. Keycloak will now return the avatar during authentication.


## RESTAction Configuration
The `RESTActionRef` field in the OAuth2 and OIDC configs is mandatory and optional, respectively. It is used to compile the following fields, used to build the Kubernetes certificate required for authentication:
- `name`: string
- `email`: string
- `preferredUsername`: string - mandatory
- `avatarURL`: string
- `groups`: []string - mandatory

In the case of OAuth2, these fields are needed to compile the certificate and the ones marked as such are mandatory. They have to be included as top level fields in the RESTAction response. See the testdata folder for a Github example. In the OIDC case, these fields are all optional, and if included will overwrite the information obtained from the id token and the userinfo endpoint.

The authentication for the endpoints of the RESTAction is automatically set to bearer token, using the token obtained from the OAuth2/OIDC authentication. If the endpoint already specifies an authentication method, then it is not overwritten and it will be used for the API calls instead of the bearer token.

## Graphics Configuration
The OAuth2 and OIDC authentication methods also support a `graphics` object that allows to configure how the button for the redirect to the authentication provider portal is visualized in the frontend login screen.
```yaml
  graphics:
    icon: # icon name from the fontawesome library, for icons like github and windows, use "fa-brands fa-github" or "fa-brands fa-windows"
    displayName: # text to be visualized on the button
    backgroundColor: # color of the button in hexadecimal, e.g., #0022ff
    textColor: # color of the text in the button, also in hexadecimal, e.g., #0022ff
```
