# finops-prometheus-exporter-generic
This repository is part of the wider exporting architecture for the Krateo Composable FinOps and exports the API endpoints of FOCUS cost reports in the Prometheus format.

For an in-depth look at the architecture and how to configure all the components, download the summary document [here](https://github.com/krateoplatformops/finops-operator-exporter/resources/Krateo_Composable_FinOps___Full.pdf).

## Overview
This component is tasked with exporting in the Prometheus format a standard FOCUS report. The report is obtained from a file mounted inside the container in "/config/config.yaml". The exporter runs on the port 2112. For each resource, it checks the provider and resource CRs, and creates new CRs for the FinOps Operator Exporter to bootstrap a new exporting pipeline for usage metrics.
