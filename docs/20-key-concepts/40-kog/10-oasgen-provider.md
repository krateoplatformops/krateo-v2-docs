# oasgen-provider

The Krateo OASGen Provider is a Kubernetes controller that generates Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) and controllers to manage resources directly from OpenAPI Specification (OAS) 3.1 documents (with support for OAS 3.0). It enables seamless integration of API-defined resources into Kubernetes environments.

## Glossary

- **CRD (Custom Resource Definition):** A Kubernetes resource that defines custom objects and their schemas.
- **RestDefinition:** A custom resource that defines how API resources are managed in Kubernetes based on OAS specifications.
- **RDC (Rest Dynamic Controller):** A controller deployed by the provider to manage resources defined by a RestDefinition.
- **OAS (OpenAPI Specification):** A standard, language-agnostic interface description for REST APIs.
- **Plugin:** A wrapper service that maintains consistent API interfaces when needed. 

## Architecture

![Generator Architecture Image](/img/kog/generator.png "Generator Architecture")

The diagram illustrates how the OASGen Provider processes OpenAPI Specifications to generate CRDs and deploy the Rest Dynamic Controller (RDC). The RDC manages custom resources and interacts with external APIs, optionally through wrapper web services when needed.

## Workflow

1. User applies a RestDefinition CR
2. Provider fetches the OAS specification
3. Provider generates CRD based on the OAS schema
4. Provider deploys the Rest Dynamic Controller
5. Controller manages custom resources according to API specifications
6. Resources are synchronized with external APIs

## Requirements

- Kubernetes cluster (v1.20+ recommended)
- Krateo BFF installed in the `krateo-system` namespace
- OpenAPI Specification 3.0+ documents for your APIs
- Network access to API endpoints from the cluster

## RestDefinition Specifications

### CRD Specification

To view the CRD configuration, visit [this link](https://doc.crds.dev/github.com/krateoplatformops/oasgen-provider).


### API Endpoints Requirements

1. Field names must be consistent across all actions (`create`, `update`, `findby`, `get`, `delete`)
2. API responses must contain all fields defined in the CRD
3. Path parameters and body fields should use consistent naming


### About RestDefinition Actions

Krateo controllers support 4 verbs to provide resource reconciliation:

- **Observe**: This verb observes the resource state in the external system. It fetches the current state of the resource. If the resource does not exist or differs from the desired state, the controller will create or update it accordingly.
  - `rest-dynamic-controller` supports searching for external resources using two actions (it is advised to specify both actions in the RestDefinition if possible, although it is not mandatory):
  - **findby**: This action finds a resource by its identifiers. The endpoint used for this action must return a list of resources that match the identifiers. This is useful when you want to find a resource based on specific criteria, such as a unique identifier or a combination of fields.
  - **get**: This action retrieves the current state of a resource. This typically fetches a single resource by its unique identifier.
- **Create**: This verb creates a new resource in the external system.
  - `rest-dynamic-controller` supports resource creation using the `create` action. The endpoint used for this action must accept a request body containing the resource data in the format defined by the OAS schema. The request body should be strongly typed to match the OAS schema, ensuring data validation before being sent to the external system. The request body is used by `oasgen-provider` to generate the CRD.
- **Update**: This verb updates an existing resource in the external system.
  - `rest-dynamic-controller` supports resource updates using the `update` action. The endpoint used for this action must use the same request body as the `create` action (it can have fewer fields, but not more, because the CRD is generated from the `create` request body).
- **Delete**: This verb deletes a resource from the external system.
  - `rest-dynamic-controller` supports resource deletion using the `delete` action. This endpoint should delete the resource from the external system. This means that `rest-dynamic-controller` expects a subsequent call to the `findby` or `get` action will not return the deleted resource. The endpoint should not return an error if the resource does not exist, as it is expected that the resource has already been deleted.
  
Any API behavior that does not match these requirements will require a web service wrapper to normalize the API interface. This is common with APIs that do not follow consistent naming conventions or have different response structures.
To learn more about web service wrappers, please refer to the [cheatsheet](./11-oasgen-provider-cheatsheet.md#extended-example-external-api-that-requires-a-webservice-to-handle-external-api-calls).

## How to Install

1. Install OASGen Provider:
```sh
helm repo add krateo https://charts.krateo.io
helm repo update
helm install krateo-oasgen-provider krateo/oasgen-provider --namespace krateo-system
```

## Security Features

- Automatic generation of RBAC policies for custom resources
- Secure credential management through Kubernetes secrets
- Field validation based on OAS schemas
- Optional web service wrappers for additional security layers

## Best Practices

1. Always use OAS 3.0+ specifications
2. Maintain consistent field naming across API endpoints
3. Use web service wrappers when API interfaces are inconsistent
4. Regularly update OAS documents to match API changes
5. Monitor controller logs with `krateo.io/connector-verbose: "true"`
