# Rest Dynamic Controller

The `rest-dynamic-controller` is an operator instantiated by the [oasgen-provider](https://github.com/krateoplatformops/oasgen-provider) to manage Custom Resources whose Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) are generated by the `oasgen-provider`.

## Overview

The `rest-dynamic-controller` is a dynamic controller that manages Remote Resources through REST APIs. It's considered "dynamic" because it can manage any type of remote resource represented by a Custom Resource Definition and its related Custom Resource. The controller is configured at startup through environment variables (or CLI parameters) to manage a specific Group Version Resource.

## How It Works

When a Custom Resource (CR) is created and its Custom Resource Definition (CRD) has been generated by a `RestDefinition` from the `oasgen-provider`, the following process occurs:

1. The `rest-dynamic-controller` instance checks if the remote resource exists by following the instructions defined in the [`RestDefinition`](https://doc.crds.dev/github.com/krateoplatformops/oasgen-provider).
2. If the resource doesn't exist, the controller performs the action described in the `verbsDescription` field of the `RestDefinition` CR.
3. For deletion requests, a similar process is followed.
4. During resource observation, the controller verifies if the remote resource is synchronized with the CR and performs updates if necessary.

## Usage Examples

Here's an example of a Custom Resource manifest:

```yaml
kind: Repo
apiVersion: gen.github.com/v1alpha1
metadata:
  name: gh-repo1
  namespace: default
  annotations:
    krateo.io/connector-verbose: "true"
spec:
  org: krateoplatformops
  name: test-generatore
  authenticationRefs:
    bearerAuthRef: bearer-gh-ref
```

This manifest represents a CR of kind `Repo` with apiVersion `gen.github.com/v1alpha1`. The CRD was generated by the oasgen-provider based on the specifications in the RestDefinition shown below.

```yaml

  oasPath: https://github.com/krateoplatformops/github-oas3/raw/1-oas-specification-fixes/openapi.yaml
  resourceGroup: gen.github.com

    kind: Repo
    identifiers:

    verbsDescription:
    - action: create
      method: POST
      path: /orgs/{org}/repos
    - action: delete
      method: DELETE
      path: /repos/{owner}/{repo}
      altFieldMapping:
        org: owner
        name: repo
    - action: get
      method: GET
      path: /repos/{owner}/{repo}
      altFieldMapping:
        org: owner
        name: repo
```
