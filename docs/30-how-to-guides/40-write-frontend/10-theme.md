# Theme customization

## Overview

Krateo `3.0.0` introduces a new **`Theme` widget** to enable dynamic customization of the application's look and feel.

By default, the application uses a **hardcoded Krateo default theme**. If a specific environment variable, called `THEME`, is provided during installation, the application will instead fetch and apply a custom `Theme` widget resource to a specific namespace.

This mechanism allows centralized theme management and runtime customization without modifying the frontend code. Additionally, this feature is useful to configure a customized logo for the application.

## Integration with Ant Design

The application uses **[Ant Design](https://ant.design/docs/react/introduce)** as the underlying design system.

The `Theme` widget maps its configuration to a frontend logic which is a combination of:
- Ant Design theme algorithms to define the base mode (dark vs light)
- Ant Design global tokens to specify design elements, such as colors, etc.
- Custom CSS variables for layout elements such as sidebar and menu

For more details about theme tokens and algorithms, refer to the [official Ant Design documentation](https://ant.design/docs/react/customize-theme).

## Default Behavior

If the `THEME` environment variable is not provided when installing Krateo, the application uses the built-in Krateo default theme.

The default theme includes:
- Light mode
- Default Krateo logo
- Default Ant Design algorithm
- Custom sidebar and menu styling
- Default primary color and typography

### Default Theme (YAML)

``` yaml
kind: Theme
apiVersion: widgets.templates.krateo.io/v1beta1
metadata:
  name: default-theme
  namespace: krateo-system
spec:
  widgetData:
    custom:
      menu:
        itemColor: '#ffffff80'
        itemHoverColor: '#f5f5f5'
        itemSelectedBg: '#11b2e266'
        itemSelectedColor: '#f5f5f5'
      sidebar:
        bgGradientEnd: '#002f46'
        bgGradientStart: '#005d8b'
    logo:
      url: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/krateoplatformops/frontend/fa5a15811c4caea3b7044135375e30b03c3df74f/src/assets/images/logo_big.svg
    mode: light
    token:
      colorBgContainer: '#FBFBFB'
      colorBgLayout: '#f5f5f5'
      colorBorder: '#E1E3E8'
      colorPrimary: '#05629A'
      fontFamily: 'Roboto,"Helvetica Neue",Arial,"Noto Sans",sans-serif'
  resourcesRefs:
    items: []
```

This configuration is embedded directly in the application as a fallback.

## Theme Properties

### Logo Customization

It is possible to define a custom logo using the `logo` property.

The logo can be provided either as:
- Inline SVG content
- External image URL

If no logo is provided, the default Krateo logo is used.

### Theme Mode

The `mode` property defines the base theme algorithm.

Supported values:

- `light`
- `dark`

The selected mode automatically maps to the corresponding Ant Design algorithm. If no algorithm is specified, the default value is set to `light`.

### Token Customization

The `token` property allows overriding Ant Design global design tokens, such as:

-   Colors
-   Typography
-   Layout styling

If a token is not explicitly overridden, the system falls back to Krateo or Ant Design default values.

### Custom Styling

The `custom` section allows defining additional layout styling such as:
-   Sidebar gradients
-   Menu colors
-   Selected/hover states

As with tokens, missing values automatically fall back to Krateo defaults.

### Example: dark mode with customized SVG logo

```yaml
kind: Theme
apiVersion: widgets.templates.krateo.io/v1beta1
metadata:
  name: dark-theme
  namespace: krateo-system
spec:
  widgetData:
    logo:
      svg:
        <svg width="100" height="100" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
          <circle cx="50" cy="50" r="40" stroke="black" stroke-width="3" fill="blue" />
        </svg>
    mode: dark
    token:
      colorPrimary: '#05629A'
      fontFamily: 'Roboto,"Helvetica Neue",Arial,"Noto Sans",sans-serif'
  resourcesRefs:
    items: []
```

## Enabling a Custom Theme

To create and use a custom theme, you must first define a `Theme` widget resource, such as the one shown in the previous section.

Once created, this resource must be referenced through an environment variable named `THEME`, which is evaluated during the installation process.

For more information about the Krateo installation process, refer to the `Install Krateo PlatformOps` section of [Krateo documentation](https://docs.krateo.io).

The association between the application and the `Theme` widget can be configured in two ways.

### Setting the variable during installation

During installation, you can define the `THEME` environment variable so that it points to the newly created `Theme` widget resource.

Example:
```bash
--set krateoplatformops.frontend.config.THEME=/call?resource=themes&apiVersion=widgets.templates.krateo.io/v1beta1&name=dark-theme&namespace=krateo-system
```

If the `THEME` variable is defined and points to a valid `Theme` widget, the application will fetch the widget, validate it and dynamically apply the customized theme at runtime.

If the fetch fails or the resource is invalid, the system safely falls back to the default Krateo theme.

### Using a Profile Override

In Krateo 3.0.0, themes are configured during installation using `krateoctl` with profile overrides. Create a `krateo-overrides.dark-theme.yaml` file with the theme configuration:

```yaml
components:
  frontend:
    stepConfig:
      install-frontend:
        with:
          values:
            config:
              THEME: "/call?resource=themes&apiVersion=widgets.templates.krateo.io/v1beta1&name=dark-theme&namespace=krateo-system"
```

Then apply the profile during installation with `krateoctl install apply`:

```bash
krateoctl install apply --version 3.0.0 --type loadbalancer --profile dark-theme
```

The `--profile dark-theme` flag tells `krateoctl` to look for `krateo-overrides.dark-theme.yaml`. When using `krateoctl`, profiles can be:

- **Remote** (from the releases repository) — profiles defined in the remote repository
- **Local** (from your filesystem) — profiles stored in your local directory, useful for custom or environment-specific configurations

If a profile exists in both locations, the remote version takes precedence, but you can override it with a local file. This is useful for local development or testing before committing changes to the releases repository.

:::warning
The `--profile dark-theme` persists across upgrades. Include it in future upgrades or it reverts to defaults. Use `plan` before `apply` to preview changes.

See [Profile Configuration](../../20-key-concepts/50-krateoctl/20-install-upgrade.md#profile-resolution) for full details.
