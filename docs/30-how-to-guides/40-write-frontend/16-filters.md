# Filters

## Overview

The `Filters` widget provides a declarative way to define how users can filter data displayed by other widgets (such as `Table` or `DataGrid`).

Visually, the `Filters` widget is rendered as a form containing one field for each filter defined in its configuration. Each field represents a filter that can be applied to a target widget. Two actions are available below the fields: the `Apply` button submits the form and applies the configured filters, while the `Reset` button clears the form and removes any previously applied filters.

Filtering is based on a shared string identifier called `prefix`:
- The `Filters` widget defines which filters exist and on which field they should be applied
- Target widgets declare which prefix they listen to
- When prefixes match, filters are applied automatically

This allows filtering logic to be configured entirely via YAML.

> [!NOTE]
> Filters are applied client side by the frontend logic. Reloading the current page will always reset any filter applied.

## Prefix

The prefix is the linking mechanism between a `Filters` widget and the target widgets it filters:
- Filters are stored and evaluated per prefix
- Multiple widgets can share the same prefix
- Prefixes must match exactly
- If a target widget does not declare a prefix, or declares a non existing one, it will not be affected by the filters

## Creating a filter

Each filter is defined as an entry in the `fields` section of the `Filters` widget. The following properties should be defined:
- `name`: one or more dot-notation paths identifying the target field(s)
- `type`: the filter type (`string`, `number`, `boolean`, `date` or `daterange`), that should match the type of the target field
- `label`: the user-facing label shown in the filter form

The `name` field accepts a list of paths. A filter matches if any of the listed paths matches the target data.

## Example

Assume a `Table` widget displaying a list of pods, with a column named `name`. In this example, the table has two rows with different values inside the `name` column. To allow filtering, this widget defines a `prefix`.

Create a `example-table-with-filter.yaml` file with the following content:

```yaml
kind: Table
apiVersion: widgets.templates.krateo.io/v1beta1
metadata:
  name: example-table-with-filter
  namespace: krateo-system
spec:
  widgetData:
    allowedResources: [barcharts, buttons, filters, flowcharts, linecharts, markdowns, paragraphs, piecharts, yamlviewers]
    prefix: example-table-with-filter-prefix
    columns:
      - valueKey: name
        title: Name
    data:
      - 
        - valueKey: name
          kind: jsonSchemaType
          type: string
          stringValue: "frontend-pod"
      - 
        - valueKey: name
          kind: jsonSchemaType
          type: string
          stringValue: "backend-pod"
```

The goal is to filter the table based on the value of the `name` column. To do that, we will need a string filter that points to the `name` field. A descriptive label is used to clearly indicate that the filter applies to the pod name. Finally, the same `prefix` defined for the table is reused in the filter definition.

Create a `example-table-with-filter-filter.yaml` file with the following content:

```yaml
kind: Filters
apiVersion: widgets.templates.krateo.io/v1beta1
metadata:
  name: example-table-with-filter-filter
  namespace: krateo-system
spec:
  widgetData:
    prefix: example-table-with-filter-prefix
    fields:
      - label: Pod Name
        name:
          - name
        type: string
```

To actually create the two widgets, execute the following commands:

```sh
kubectl apply -f {YOUR_PATH}/example-table-with-filter.yaml
kubectl apply -f {YOUR_PATH}/example-table-with-filter-filter.yaml
```

Once both widgets are configured and applied, this is the final result displayed:

If `prefix` matches, the filter is automatically applied to the table when users interact with the `Filters` widget.
