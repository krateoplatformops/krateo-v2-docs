# Krateo 2.6.0 ‚Äì Expanding the Marketplace, Enhancing Performance

Krateo 2.6.0 builds on the foundation set in 2.5.1, delivering better scalability in the frontend, expanding the Blueprint Marketplace, and improving FinOps capabilities.

	‚Ä¢	Azure Pricing

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes (from 2.5.1)

**Frontend**
Some widgets now require new properties to ensure consistency and error-free behavior:
	‚Ä¢	A new property headers is required in widgets that use actions of type rest.
	‚Ä¢	Example: [portal-blueprint-page](https://github.com/krateoplatformops-blueprints/portal-blueprint-page/blob/main/blueprint/templates/button.panel-button-cleanup.yaml#L19)
	‚Ä¢	A new property allowedResources is required to explicitly define supported child resources. This applies to the following widgets:
	‚Ä¢	Column
	‚Ä¢	DataGrid
	‚Ä¢	NavMenu
	‚Ä¢	NavMenuItem
	‚Ä¢	Page
	‚Ä¢	RoutesLoader
	‚Ä¢	Row
	‚Ä¢	TabList
	‚Ä¢	Table

## ‚è≥ Not in 2.6.0 (but coming soon)

CDC Performance
	‚Ä¢	Significant work has been done to reduce memory footprint for handling thousands of concurrent composition creations.
	‚Ä¢	This feature is not yet included in 2.6.0 but will arrive in an upcoming release.

üëâ With this release, Krateo continues to evolve towards a scalable, composable, and marketplace-driven platform that empowers teams to move faster while keeping governance in place.
